# Dual RNA-Seq in a Malaria Co-infection Bacteremia


![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=57afa1c84a&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r2295766110414945034&th=17c61e032bf84e39&view=att&disp=safe&realattid=f_kuiwg6010)


## 1.	Background

**What is the current problem?**

The clinical diagnosis and distinction between malaria and bacteraemia is a challenge to clinicians due to their overlapping symptoms. This causes a potential risk of misdiagnosis and in turn inappropriate treatment therapy provision or death.

**What tools are currently used to distinguish the two?**

* Use of clinical indicators, such as bivariate and multivariate regression analyses
* Triage classification and grouping of severe infections based on Point of care rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results
* Implementation of available clinical guidelines on case-by-case management
* Risk assessment biomarker usage 
* clinical-based algorithms adoption

**What are we proposing**

We propose use of dual RNA-seq to quantify RNA transcripts of blood from patients co-infected with malaria and bacteraemia. 

**To achieve this we ought to:**
1. Use of Next generation sequencing to provide a more sensitive, specific and accurate method for the etiologic distinction of malaria and bacteraemia
2. Use differential gene expression analysis profiles to identify unique signatures between patients co-infected with malaria and bacteraemia 
3.	Determine the synergistic pathways involved
