# Transcriptional profiles analysis of children infected with COVID-19 and malaria infection reveals potential biomarkers

## 1.	Background

**What is the current problem?**

The clinical diagnosis and distinction between malaria and COVID-19 is a challenge to clinicians due to their overlapping symptoms. This causes a potential risk of misdiagnosis and in turn inappropriate treatment therapy provision or death.

**What tools are currently used to distinguish the two?**

* Use of clinical indicators, such as bivariate and multivariate regression analyses.
* Triage classification and grouping of severe infections based on Point of care rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results.
* Implementation of available clinical guidelines on case-by-case management.
* Risk assessment biomarker.
* Clinical-based algorithms. 

**What are we proposing**

We use public datasets of RNA-seq data to quantify RNA transcripts of blood from patients with malaria and COVID-19 infection. 

**To achieve this we ought to:**
1. Use of Next generation sequencing data which provide a more sensitive, specific and accurate method for the etiologic distinction of malaria and COVID-19.
2. Use differential gene expression analysis profiles to identify unique signatures between children patients with malaria and COVID-19. 
3. Determine the common genes differentially expressed between malaria and COVID-19 diseases.
